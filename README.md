### Style guide

Rule of thumb: Follow the style of the surrounding code!

I like space between the function name and the argument list. But do as
you please.

Keep it simple and minimalistic. Usability over esthetics. Don't try to
be to clever. Try to write self explanatory code. Document the code if
your are doing something non-obvious.
